* Curator Front-End (React Framework)

The front-end website for Curator. Basically, the ~<video>~ tag inbetween user and creator.

** Terminology

- Curator :: The proper noun name of the entire platform.

- Channel :: A user on the site that has created Posts.

- Tracker :: A user that tracks posts from a given channel.

- Post :: A description of content and where to find it. Title, info section, URI, things like that.

** Developers

For the API to work on the local dev server, you will need to either use firebase emulators or get the admin SDK service account key and put it in =src/serviceAccount.json=.

To start the development server on =localhost:3000=
#+begin_src shell
  npm run dev
#+end_src

You can alternatively run everything locally using Firebase Emulators (finnicky and doesn't often work for me, but it may for you).
#+begin_src shell
  firebase emulators:start
#+end_src


** Goals

See [[file:TODO.org]].
